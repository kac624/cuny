# Question #1 - Loop to calculate 12!

Define function
```{r}
factorial <- function(input){
  product <- 1
  list <- (1:input)
  for (val in list){
    n <- list[length(list)-val+1]
    product <- product * n
  }
  return(product)
}
```

Use function to calculate 12!
```{r}
factorial(12)
```


# Question #2 - Numeric Vector with sequence 20 to 50 by 5

```{r}
v <- seq(from = 20, to = 50, by = 5)
print(v)
```


# Question #3 - Quadratic Function

Define function
```{r}
quadratic <- function(a,b,c){
  x_1 <- (-b + sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
  x_2 <- (-b - sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
  print(x_1)
  print(x_2)
}
```

Example #1
```{r}
quadratic(2,-5,-3)
```

Example #1
```{r}
quadratic(2, 9, -5)
```
