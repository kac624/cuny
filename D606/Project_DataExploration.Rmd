## Election Results Data

MIT Election Lab
https://electionlab.mit.edu/data

U.S. House 1976â€“2020
https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/IG0UN2

```{r election-data}
elections <- read_csv('data/1976-2020-house.csv')

glimpse(elections)

elections <- filter(elections, stage == 'GEN')
```

Calculate wasted votes per candidate
```{r}
elections <- mutate(elections, yearStateDist = paste0(year, state_po, district))

elections <- elections %>% 
  group_by(yearStateDist) %>% 
  mutate(result = case_when(candidatevotes == max(candidatevotes) ~ 'winner',
                            candidatevotes != max(candidatevotes) ~ 'loser')) %>%
  ungroup()


elections <- elections %>%
  mutate(wastedVotes = case_when(result == 'winner' ~ (candidatevotes - (totalvotes %/% 2)),
                                 result == 'loser' ~ candidatevotes),
         wastedVotes = case_when(party == 'DEMOCRAT' ~ -wastedVotes,
                                 party == 'REPUBLICAN' ~ wastedVotes,
                                 TRUE ~ 0)
         )

elections %>%
  select(year, state_po, district, candidate, party, 
         candidatevotes, totalvotes, result, wastedVotes) %>%
  head(9)
```

Calculate efficiency gap per state per year
```{r}
eff_gap <- elections %>%
  group_by(year, state_po) %>%
  summarize(netWastedVotes = sum(wastedVotes),
            totalVotes = sum(totalvotes),
            eff_gap = abs(netWastedVotes / totalVotes)
            ) %>%
  arrange(year, desc(eff_gap))

eff_gap %>% 
  mutate(eff_gap = percent(eff_gap, 0.01)) %>%
  filter(year == 2018)
```

## Members of Congress data

Primarily to link the two datasets.
https://theunitedstates.io/

```{r member-data, message=FALSE}
members_current <- read_csv('https://theunitedstates.io/congress-legislators/legislators-current.csv')
members_history <- read_csv('https://theunitedstates.io/congress-legislators/legislators-historical.csv')

members <- rbind(members_history, members_current)
```

## Combining datasets

```{r}

combo <- mutate(combo, percent_vote = candidatevotes / totalvotes)

head(combo,10)
```


```{r}
