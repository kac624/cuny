# Introduction

This assignment tasked us with predicting a discrete count variable: the number of wine cases sold to distribution companies after tasting. The dataset contains variables detailing various chemical characteristics of the wine, as well as ratings from industry experts. The dataset is characterized by a large volume of missing observations, which introduced challenges in terms of model performance. Ultimately, we found that linear approaches struggled to capture the relationship between the predictors and sales, with average prediction errors around 1 box. Some non-linear approaches, however, showed promising results.

# Data Exploration

The data covers 12,795 types of wine. For each type of wine, the dataset details 12 chemical properties (e.g., the level of alcohol, chlorides, sulfates, citric acid), two ratings (e.g., expert tasters' ratings and marketing ratings) and the number of cases sold to distributors.

The target variable (cases sold) consists of positive, discrete value (see `Figure 1`). Moreover, the distribution exhibits slight right skew, indicating that a Poisson distribution may provide an appropriate fit for modeling. The target, however, also contains a significant number of wines for which zero cases were sold. This finding indicated that our model would need to include a zero-inflation factor.

![Distribution of Target Variable](plots/target_dist.png)

The predictor variables include mostly continuous chemical measurements, all of which were roughly normally distributed (see `Figure 2`). There were, however, three exceptions: `AcidIndex` (a discrete measure of acidity), `LabelAppeal` (a marketing rating on how customers respond to the wine label) and `STARS` (a taste rating). `AcidIndex` covers a relatively wide range, and it is based on a weighted average. It therefore appears best left as a numerical value. `LabelAppeal` and `STARS`, however, cover only five and four discrete values, respectively. Moreover, they are more subjective measures. As a result, we predicted these features may be best dealt with as categorical variables.

![Distributions of Predictor Variables](plots/feature_dists.png)

To get a quick snapshot of relationships across all variables, we generated a correlation matrix (see `Figure 3`). It is important to recognize the limitations of this plot when dealing with count regression modeling. Specifically, these models typically use a log link function, and the target variables typically exhibit skewness, and the such models typically use a log link function. So, Pearson's correlation may not be the best indicator of relevant relationships. Still, these plots can identify multicollinearity. Moreover, a correlation matrix with the target variable log-transformed (also included below) can provide a better view of potential predictors. Unfortunately, the plot indicated relatively weak relationships across all variables. The exceptions were `AcidIndex`, `LabelAppeal` and `STARS`, which appeared weakly correlated with the target in both raw and log-transformed states.

![Pairwise Correlation Matrix Across All Variables](plots/corr_matrix.png)

Finally, we examined missing values in our data. The upset plot below (see `Figure 4`) shows the variables with the highest frequency of missing values. We found over 2,500 observations for which the `STARS` rating is not available, and multiple other variables with hundreds of missing values. To avoid losing a significant portion of our training data, we predicted we would need to consider imputation.

# Data Preparation

To prepare our data for modeling, we first created a validation subset to provide an unbiased estimate of model performance. We wanted to use this subset to provide feedback on models both with and without imputation, so we first removed all NAs, giving us 6436 complete observations. Then, we randomly sampled 20% of these observations, giving us 1287 observations for validation. The validation subset therefore comprised ~10% of the original 12,795 observations, leaving 11,508 observations for training.

We then took an iterative approach to generate multiple datasets for modeling. The goal was to allow us to view incremental impacts of various preprocessing steps on model performance.  

  • First, we created a training set with all NAs removed, leaving 6436 observations (as noted above). All variables were left as is, including `LabelAppeal` and `STARS`, which we left as numerical variables. The goal for this dataset was to provide a baseline for performance.
  
  • Next, we converted the `STARS` variable to a factor and adding a new level (`missing`) to denote when the rating was not available. Given the large volume of NAs (~2,500) under this predictor, we predicted that the missing values may actually serve as a sort of signal to the model. In this dataset, we also converted the other categorical variable, `LabelAppeal` from numerical to factor format. With the `STARS` NAs filled in, the dataset had 8675 total observations for training.  
  
  • We then created two datasets with imputed values for the remaining numerical variables. The first leveraged a simple mean imputation, and the second leveraged the MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations) method. This approach imputes missing data by iteratively modeling each variable with missing values as a function of the other variables, with the goal of minimizing the distortions that may come with simpler imputation methods. With all NAs imputed, this dataset returned to the original count of 11,508 observations for training.  
  • Given the minimal correlation shown in our correlation matrices, we created another dataset with additional generated features. Specifically, we added polynomial terms ($x^2$) for all 12 numerical variables. We also predicted that the interactions of chemical attributes may better explain consumer tastes and preferences, so we generated pairwise interactions terms, bringing the total number of features to 78. When then enacted backward stepwise feature elimination to remove insignificant variables, bring the feature set back down to 24 variables.
  
With all of these steps, we created a complete validation dataset, as well as a series of training datasets that accounted for missing values, categorical variables, potential interactions and non-linear relationships.

# Build Models

For all of the above training datasets, we fit Poisson regression models. As uncovered during data exploration, the target variable consistents of positive counts and exhibits a slight right skew. Both of these conditions indicate a good fit for Poisson modeling. For all models, we assessed the residuals, dispersion, deviance, mean absolute error (MAE) and Akaike information criterion (AIC). We cover each of these below, with results summarized in the table at the end of this section (see `Figure 6`).

Regarding residuals, we analysed the scatterplot of Pearson residuals against fitted values (see `Figure 5`). We observed the "banding" pattern shown below, but we recognized this is common with Poisson count models (given the discrete nature of the response variable). Ideally, the residuals should exhibit constant spread, and while the plot appeared appropriate overall, we did observe a slight curve, particularly with the red trend line. This indicated some potential non-linearity in the relationship between predictors and response. Interestingly, the introduction of polynomial and interaction terms appeared to at least partially address this. The same residual plot for the model including factor variables, imputed numerical variables and generated features exhibited no such curve.

![Residual versus Fitted Scatterplot for Baseline and Enhanced Poisson Models](plots/residuals.png)

Regarding dispersion, we wanted to ensure that we adhered to the primary assumption for Poisson modeling: that mean and variance are equal. Dispersion provide an assessment of that adherence, calculated as sum of squared Pearson residuals divided by the residual degrees of freedom. While our baseline model exhibited significant underdispersion (indicating the model may be too simple), most of the other models had dispersion metrics near 1, indicating a good fit. Still, we fit two negative binomial models, one based on the original features (with imputation) and one based on the selected generated features.

Finally, we also examined AIC, MAE (both across training and validation subsets) and deviance. These metrics provide an indication of model fit, prediction errors and comparison to a fully saturated model (i.e., a model that perfectly predicts the observed data under the Poisson distribution). In all cases, lower values indicate a better fit. The results are collected in `Figure 6`.

Surprisingly, the baseline model shows some of the best performance, with low AIC and Deviance, and comparable out-of-sample errors. The second model (with categorical variables converted to factors and missing values added as another level) provideds comparable performance. Unfortunately, these models are unable to handle observations with missing values, making it unfit for purpose. The remaining models (the models with all imputed values, the models with generated numerical features, and negative binomial and  zero-inflation variations) all exhibit comparable performance. 
  
Ultimately, it seems that the various enhancements we pursued (i.e., imputation, feature generation, alternative frameworks like negative binomial and zero-inflation) did little to improve model performance. We suspect that the feature set does not provide sufficient information to accurately predict sales, and/or that the generalized linear model framework fails to capture the relationships between predictors and response. 

For the sake of comparison, we also fit several non-count models. First, we fit two multiple linear regression models, using the original variables with imputation. Given the skewed distribution in the target variable, we fit one with the target variable log-transformed, and one without transformation.

Second, we fit two models that do not rely on a linear framework. Specifically, we used the ensemble decision tree approach, random forest, which can better capture non-linear relationships. Again, we fit two models, one that directly aimed to predict the target variable in discrete form, and another that captured the log-transformed target. Surprisingly, these `rf` models provided similar performance as the count models on in-sample data, but its out-of-sample performance appeared much better. 

![Summary of Model Performance](plots/summary.png)

# Model Selection

For final model selection, we considered fit, conceptual soundness and interpretibility. Regarding fit, there is not a huge difference across models. For the most part, in-sample average errors were just over 1, and out-of-sample errors were around 0.86. The random forest models were the only exception, as they showed considerably better performance out-of-sample, most likely due to the lack of observations with missing values out of sample.

Regarding conceptual soundness, model diagnostics did not reveal any major issues that would highlight failed assumptions. The one exception was the zero-inflation poisson model with generated features (labeled `zip model - generated features (with factors)` in the summary table), which indicated errors of a lack of convergence. None of the count models exhibited material overdispersion, so the negative binomial may not provide the best fit. By contrast, the target variable does contain a significant number of zeros, which the zero-inflation models are best situated to handle.

Regarding interpretibility, most models provide reasonably interpretible coefficients, with one exception: random forest. Interpreting the impact of individual variables on the response can be assisted with feature importance, but the exact relationship is difficult to explain.

![Zero-Inflation Model Summary](plots/zipSummary.png)

Based on these considerations, we chose the zero-inflation poisson model with original features (labeled `zip model - mice imputed` in the summary table) as the final model. It is equipped to handle response variables with many zeros, it provides comparable performance to the other models, and its highly interpretible. The model summary is shown in `Figure 7`.

Several key insights emerge. Both of the categorical variables appear significant, and higher ratings appear to have a positive effect on the number of cases sold. That is, higher ratings on Label Appeal and the STARS scale may drive more sales. Interestingly, when the STARS rating is missing, there seems to be a significant negative impact on sales, indicating that distributors tend to avoid purchasing unrated wines. Looking to the chemical characteristics, the Acid Index and Volatile Acidity score both have significant negative effects on sales, indicating the distributors may avoid overly acidic wines. Finally, Alcohol Content has a significant and pronounced positive effect on sales, indicating that people like the strong stuff!

Overall, these results provide several key insights. Among the wines offered, distributors seem to prefer rated wines with appealing labels, low acidity and higher alcohol content.
