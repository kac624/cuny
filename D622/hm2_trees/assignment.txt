Pre-work

Read this blog: https://decizone.com/blog/the-good-the-bad-the-ugly-of-using-decision-trees which shows some of the issues with decision trees
Choose a dataset from a source in Assignment #1, or another dataset of your choice.

Assignment work
Based on the latest topics presented, choose a dataset of your choice and create a Decision Tree where you can solve a classification problem and predict the outcome of a particular feature or detail of the data used.
Switch variables* to generate 2 decision trees and compare the results. Create a random forest and analyze the results.
Based on real cases where desicion trees went wrong, and 'the bad & ugly' aspects of decision trees (https://decizone.com/blog/the-good-the-bad-the-ugly-of-using-decision-trees), how can you change this perception when using the decision tree you created to solve a real problem?

Deliverable
Essay (minimum 500 word document)
Write a short essay explaining your analysis, and how you would address the concerns in the blog (listed in pre-work)
Exploratory Analysis using R or Python (submit code + errors + analysis as notebook or copy/paste to document)

* Note:
1. We are trying to train 2 different decision trees to compare bias and variance - so swicth the features used for the first node (split) to force a different decision tree (How did the performance change?)
2. You will create 3 models: 2 x decision trees (to compare variance) and a random forest
