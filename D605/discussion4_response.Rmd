I think instead of plugging the values of each column vector as a scalar to multiply by the basis vectors of C, we need to solve for those scalars as a system of linear equations. So, for $$ \rho_{C}(T(1)) $$, we shouldn't plug in the values of [2, 1, 3], but instead solve for the scalars that, when used in a linear combination with the vectors of C, give us [2, 1, 3]. In this case, those scalars come out to [ 1,-2, 3]. To illustrate:

$$ \rho_{C}(T(1)) = \rho_{C}\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} = \rho_{C} \left(1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + -2 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0  end{bmatrix} + 3 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \right) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} $$

And that vector serves as the first column in our matrix represenation. If we continue for all of B, I believe this is our final representation:

$$ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -4 & 5 & -3 \\ -2 & 1 & -3 & 4 \\ 3 & 0 & 2 & -3 \end{bmatrix} $$

Let me know if that checks out!
